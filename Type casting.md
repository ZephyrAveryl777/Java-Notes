## Type Casting 
- when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
<br>
In Java, there are two types of casting:

- Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
**`byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`**

- Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
**`double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`**
