# Java Introduction 
- programming language and a platform 
- high level, robust, object-oriented and secure 
---
### Background 
- Developed by Sun Microsystems (now the subsidary of oracle ) in 1995
- James Gosling is known as the father of Java. 
- Before Java, its name was Oak,but oak had been taken so named it as Java 
>  Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API so its called a platform,(any hardware or software environment in which a program runs)
---
### Used for: 
- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection ... etc!!

### Advantages of Java 
- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast and powerful
- It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

### Types of Java Application 
4 types of application can be created using Java programming:
- **Standalone Application:** 
    - also known as desktop application or window-based applications. 
    - traditional software that need to be installed on machine. 
    - _Example_: Media player, antivirus, etc. 
    - AWT and Swing are used for creating Standalone application 
- **Web Application:**
    -  application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page 
    -  Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF technologies are used for creating web application.
- **Enterprise Application:**
   - application that is distributed in nature 
   - has advantages of high-level security, load balancing, clustering
   - EJB is used for creating enterprise application. 
- **Mobile Application:**
   - application created for mobile devices 
   - Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile application
