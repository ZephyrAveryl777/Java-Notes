# Features of Java 
- Pirmary objective was to make it portable, simple and secure. 
- Many new features have been added and they are : <br>

</h3>

- **Object Oriented**: 
  - In Java, everything is an Object. 
  - can be easily extended since based on the Object model.
- **Platform Independent**: 
  - when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine,
  - rather into platform independent byte code. 
  - This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
- **Simple**: 
  - designed to be easy to learn. 
- **Secure**: 
  - enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. 
  - Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
- **Architecture-neutral**: 
  - Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, 
  - making the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
- **Portable**: 
  - architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. 
  - Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
- **Robust**: 
  - eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
- **Multithreaded**:
  - possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. 
  - allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.
- **Interpreted**: 
  - Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. 
  - The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.
- **High Performance**: 
  - With the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, Java enables high performance.
- **Distributed**: 
  - Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.
- **Dynamic**: 
  - considered more dynamic than C or C++ since designed to adapt to an evolving environment. 
  - Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
